This is a speech2text project repository where the folder contains various 
python scripts and pretrained models for solving the call recordings for customer care
and speaker labelling using the technique called speaker diarization. The problem of analyzing the
customer audio call recordings can be solved using the state of the art nlp algorithm and here we are using 
OpenAI whisper which is a Multi Lingual speech to text model which transcribes and translates the customer call recording data.
